# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Blender portait lighting plug in

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will easily and efficiently allow the user to add portrait lighting to their blender scene. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will eliminate a busy task for me and other blender users. Lighting can be time-consuming to set up in every scene. With my plugin, it will add a choice of 3 lighting presets on the side tab of blender.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be for me to eliminate creating new lighting setups in every scene.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be for the user to create their own presets and store it in my plugin.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be for the user to be able to customize the plugin to their liking.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps are to code my plugin into blender and have a working sidetab. I will research script writing in blender to complete my project.
